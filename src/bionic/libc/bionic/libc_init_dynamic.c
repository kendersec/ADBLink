 * libc_init_dynamic.c

 * This source files provides two important functions for dynamic
 * executables:
 *
 * - a C runtime initializer (__libc_preinit), which is called by
 *   the dynamic linker when libc.so is loaded. This happens before
 *   any other initializer (e.g. static C++ constructors in other
 *   shared libraries the program depends on).
 *
 * - a program launch function (__libc_init), which is called after
 *   all dynamic linking has been performed. Technically, it is called
 *   from arch-$ARCH/bionic/crtbegin_dynamic.S which is itself called
 *   by the dynamic linker after all libraries have been loaded and
 *   initialized.
